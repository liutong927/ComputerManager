1.use QTableView to bind to data model which is database data in this case;
  model/view framework to easily show various views of one model.
  QTableWidget has private setModel, cannot be used to set our own model.
2.should not create in-memory database, but persistent db file?
  use setDatabaseName to create in-memory and in-disk db file.

1.alway keep current table view has one empty row at end of table, for easily edit one new record.
  this will avoid providing "Insert row" functionality in UI.
  also means when add a new row and submit to db, we will create an empty one.

1.do not insert empty row by default. This may leads complicated implementation.
  adding pushbutton of Add/Delete/Search to invoke command. this will help create more complicated operation for single command.
  e.g, specify date range for search, create reminder for Adding item.

1.Now sql table use Date as primary key, the unique constraint disallows to create multiple items for same date.
  use another primary key like index? Or do not use primary key at all?
